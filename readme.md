# Etch-A-Sketch
A project for (The Odin Project)[https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project] by (bardonfro)[https://github.com/bardonfro/etch-a-sketch].

## What I've Learned
- Differences between flex-box and grid
- Percentages for size don't work unles the parent has a defined size (duh).
- CSS calc() for dimensions is really handy, but box-sizing: box-border is much handier.
- Passing an event and acting on its properties in the handler
- Different event handler triggers
- A little bit of flex layout
- Opacity settings
