# Etch-A-Sketch
A project for (The Odin Project)[https://www.theodinproject.om].

## What I've Learned
- Differences between flex-box and grid


### Inline block method
- Percentages for size don't work unles the parent has a defined size (duh).
- CSS calc() for dimensions is really handy
- Passing an event and acting on its properties in the handler
